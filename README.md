## About the Project

This project was born out of my desire to maintain and further develop my skills. With the upcoming elections as inspiration, I began building a type of voting guide. Initially, the idea was to highlight just a few parties and their viewpoints. However, the project has grown into a quite usable voting guide. It does not offer extensive features but allows users to easily discover which statements they agree with, based on parties they select themselves. An interesting aspect of this project was experimenting with ChatGPT for summarizing election programs, where I uploaded the PDFs of the programs of all parties included in the app.
